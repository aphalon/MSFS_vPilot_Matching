# MSFS vPilot Model Matching

## Summary

Repo to store .vmr files to enable vPilot to render non-standard models (those that are outside of the FSLTL models at least) for custom matching of planes flying on the VATSIM network.

## Model list

|Type Code|Model mapping|File|
|---------|-------------|----|
|A339|Headwind A330neo in Headwind Livery|`headwindsim-aircraft-a330-900.vmr`|

## Installation/Configuration

Download the .vmr files needed into a specific folder and remember where you put them...

In vPilot goto `Settings`... then expand the `Model Matching (MSFS)` tree by click on the (+) and select `Custom Rules`. Click on the `Add Custom Rule Set(s)` button and select whichever files you want to model match... repeat as required.
